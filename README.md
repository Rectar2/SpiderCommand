SpiderCommand allows you to launch and control a Windows command prompt through your browser using WebSockets.

## Running
**ANYONE ON YOUR NETWORK CAN CONNECT TO YOUR SPIDERCOMMAND SERVER WITHOUT AUTHENTICATION! USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!**

To set up SpiderCommand, go to the directory where you cloned the repository and run `npm install`. After installing all of the dependencies, you can run SpiderCommand with `node src/run.js`. The script will print the port and host the server is listening on to the console.
